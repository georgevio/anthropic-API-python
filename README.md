This code does connect via API to the anthropic AI library (named Claude) at https://www.anthropic.com/ . The engine currently (2024) provides only such connection (testing purposes) and DOES NOT provide web access. The current code is simplistic (gets the job done) with two text windows, the top for writing the question, and the bottom to fetch the results. You can also try to upload an image or a document (not tested).

IMPORTANT: YOU NEED AN API KEY (FREE Currently)! Code will not work without it. Instructions on how to get it, here https://www.anthropic.com/api

pip install anthropic
apt-get install python3-tk
apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk

Code also works in Windows (tested)
